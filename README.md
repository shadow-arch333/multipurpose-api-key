# Master API Key Transformation System

This repository demonstrates a pattern for using a single master API key to derive service-specific tokens for multiple API utilities (AI, MCP, Docker, etc.).

## Overview

- **Master API Key**: A single credential provided to users.
- **Key Transformation Logic**: Utility code to transform or derive service-specific tokens from the master key.
- **Security Considerations**: Centralized revocation, scoped tokens, and no static client-side secrets.

## Files

- [`key_transform.py`](./key_transform.py): Python utility for deriving service keys.
- [`examples.md`](./examples.md): Usage examples and workflow explanations.

## Usage

1. Copy the files into your repo.
2. Use the `key_transform.py` script to generate service-specific tokens.
3. Refer to `examples.md` for workflow details and customization.

## Security Notes

- All transformation should ideally occur server-side.
- Never expose master keys in client apps.
- Use short-lived tokens and secure key derivation functions.
